# EPL_FootballMatch_Predictions
This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict the outcomes of English Premier League (EPL) football matches. The model uses historical match data from the 2020-2021 and 2021-2022 seasons to train a Random Forest Classifier to predict match results. With a precision of 67.5%, this model provides an estimate of match outcomes based on features like the goals for, goals against, shots averaged etc which were feature engineered using thier rolling values to increase precision along with other features like the venue code, the opposition and even the hour and day of the week in which the team was playing
